# Changes in Cells Bridge

## Version 3.18.0
 - `New feature`: Many urls to one page. Cells Bridge supports having many urls associated with the same page.
 - `New feature`: improve Semaas error handling.

## Version 3.17.3
- `Bug fix`: Native bridge breaking due to getInterceptorContext is not a BridgeChannelManager's method.

## Version 3.17.2
- `Bug fix`: Custom 404 page not working.

## Version 3.17.1
- `Bug fix`: Router interceptor fails when updating channels with dynamic pages in CellsNative.

## Version 3.17.0
- `New feature`: Router interceptor. Cells Bridge adds an interceptor function that applications can use to stop a navigation or redirect based on its business logic.
- `New feature`: Monitoring with Semaas has support for applications that handles more than one tsec to authenticate.
- `New feature`: Support web-component pages without shadow DOM.

## Version 3.16.0
- `New feature`: Cells Bridge is also distributed in compressed file format (brotli) to take advantage of modern web servers and improve network performance.
- `New feature`: the feature flag collection can be updated using the newly created function` updateFeatureFlagCollection` on the object `cells` (`cells.updateFeatureFlagCollection`).
- `New feature`: Cells Bridge now supports multiple cross-components of the same type.
- `New function`: It is possible to define the log level priority for Semass. When setting a log level, only traces with the same or higher priority level go through Semaas.
- `New feature`: the object `cells` has a new method `flush` (`cells.flush`) that is used to send to Semaas the log traces that could be pending sending.

## Version 3.15.2
- `New feature`: attributes are defined explicitly in json using the property "`attributes`" instead of letting Bridge infer its role. To ensure compatibility with previous version, the attributes `ambient` and `variant` in the properties section are treated as attributes, this will be deprecated as Cells Bridge 4 is released and both attributes will have to be defined in the attributes section.

## Version 3.15.1
- `Bug fix`: after resetting channels, reconnect cross components declared manually in index.tpl`
- `Bug fix`: defensive approach to distinguish attributes in Polymer 2.

## Version 3.15.0
- `New feature`: better use of url params with dynamic navigations in dynamic pages.
- `New feature`: the requirement that templates have a name starting with cells-template has been removed. Now it is enough to add the attribute `data-cells-type="template"`
- `Bug fix`: logout action in native apps won't remove current template if it's the initial template.
- `Bug fix`: declarative templates in native apps won't work.

## Version 3.14.0
- `New feature`: Bundled pages for mixed applications (Polymer+LitElement). Now it can load modules having LitElements that are used by Polymer pages.

## Version 3.13
- `New feature`: Bundled pages. In the case of LitElement pages, Cells Bridge, before browsing, loads the page bundle as it has been doing with vulcanized Polymer pages.
- `New feature`: Component Layouts. Dynamic pages allow you to add layout components (containers) and indicate that other components get into zones within these layout components.
- `New feature`: Feature flag. It now supports action connections.

## Version 3.12
- `New feature`: Enabled trackEvent API.
- `New feature`: Tweak policy configuration for bridge monitoring.

## Version 3.11
- `New feature`: The new version of Cells Bridge allows you to create microfrontends apps.

## Version 3.10
- `New feature`: The `cleanUntil` option, previously enabled only in `native-cells-bridge`, now is available for navigations in web apps.
- `New feature`: - SeMAAS connector configuration has been improved to be more flexible (dnsTld, & version).

## Version 3.9
- `New feature`: Feature flag, a system to enable or disable components in dinamic pages.
- `Bug fix`: Fixed rare case when different components that read from same channel could be activated twice for the same event.

## Version 3.8

- `New feature`: Upgrade RxJs to version 6.
- `New feature`: Components and pages can explicitely unsubscribe from channels (available in declarative pages).
- `New feature`: Support for local Composer engine.
- `Bug fix`: Page context change event was triggered twice (native engine).
- `Bug fix`: Escape value parameters in url.

## Version 3.6.1

## Version 0.8.0

- `New Feature`. RxJs 5. Cells now it's using the latest version of RxJs which brings a big improvement in performance.

- `Bug Fixes`. This version has fixes for:
  - Logout. The transition between pages when doing a logout wasn't smooth. It's been solved.
  - Property-changed event. When two components fired an event with the same name, different channels listening to the event could get wrong values. That was due to Polymer using cache for events. Now, Polymer's event cache can be disabled. Just set to `false` the property `avoidPolymerEventCache` when creating an instance of `CellsPolymerBridge` in the `app.js` file:
  ```javascript
      var bridge = new window.CellsPolymerBridge({
      avoidPolymerEventCache: true,
      ...
  ```

## Version 0.7.1

- `Bug fixes`. These release solves the following problems:
  - Event retargeting with shady-dom (Safari/Firefox) were not working properly.
  - Navigate to the same page triggered multiple times the same event.
  - The logout function didn't reconnect cross components when there were more than one registered in the initial page.

## Version 0.7.0

- `New feature`. Logout. Cells now implements a logout function. This function does:

  - It removes every template from the DOM.
  - It removes every template from the Cells' cache.
  - It resets every channel (including the private channels).
  - It resets every cross component.
  - It navigates to the another page (usually the login page).

- `New feature`. Handle missing page definition. When a page definition (.json file) is not found, the bridge can redirect to a custom error page.

- `New feature`. Control multiple instances of Cells Bridge. It prints on console a warning message when there are more than one instance of the bridge.

## Version 0.6.0

- `New feature`. Cells now has support for:

  - Fast `R`ender of the initial route
  - `L`azy load and creation of remaining routes on demand.

  These are two steps toward the [PRPL pattern](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/prpl-pattern/?hl=en).
